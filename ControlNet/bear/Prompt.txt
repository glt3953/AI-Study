那是一九七五年二三月间，一个平平常常的日子，细蒙蒙的雨丝夹着一星半点的雪花，正纷纷淋淋地向大地飘洒着。时令已经快到惊蛰，雪当然再也不会存留，往往还没等落地，就已经消失得无踪无影了。黄土高原严寒而漫长的冬天看来就要过去，但那真正温暖的春天还远远没有到来。
It was in February and March 1975, on an ordinary day, the thin raindrops of rain sandwiched between a star and a half of snow, and they were watered to the earth. The time is fast approaching, of course, the snow will never remain, often before the landing, it has disappeared without a trace. The cold and long winter of the Loess Plateau seemed to be passing, but the truly warm spring was far from over.

The harsh and long winter on the Loess Plateau seems to be coming to an end, but the truly warm spring is far from here.
